This is a list of things we'd love for our new chat app to do. Think ChatGPT, but with our own touch and some cool file features, all built with React/Vite on the front, FastAPI on the back, and powered by OpenAI.

Core Chatting Experience:

Chat like with a human (but it's AI!):
I want to type a message in a box and hit send (or Enter).
I want to see my messages and the AI's replies show up in a nice, scrollable chat window.
The AI's brain should be OpenAI (let's aim for gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4 if we can).
It'd be great to see a little "AI is thinking..." or "typing..." indicator so I know it's working.
Starting Fresh:
I want a big, clear "âœ¨ New Chat" button.
When I click it, the current chat clears, and I can start a new conversation from scratch (maybe with a friendly "Hello!" from the AI).
Remembering Our Conversations (Chat History):

Save my chats!
The app needs to remember all my different chat sessions.
Each chat should be saved on the backend (as its own JSON file).
Easy access to old chats:
I want to see a list of my past chats on the left side of the screen.
Each chat in the list should have a little title (maybe the first few words I typed, or a timestamp).
The chat I'm currently looking at should be highlighted in that list.
Revisit and Continue:
I want to be able to click on any chat in the history list to open it up.
When I open an old chat, I should see all the messages from that conversation and be able to continue chatting if I want.
Working with Files & Photos:

Upload stuff:
I want a button (like a paperclip ðŸ“Ž) to upload files.
I should be able to upload images (like JPGs, PNGs).
I should also be able to upload documents (PDFs, TXT files, maybe Word docs and CSVs).
See what I uploaded:
If I upload an image, I want to see a small preview of it right in the chat message.
If I upload a document, I want to see its filename in the chat message.
AI understanding files (the dream!):
The AI should know I've uploaded a file.
Ideally, for images, the AI could "see" them (if we use a vision-capable OpenAI model).
For documents, it'd be amazing if the AI could "read" the text and talk about it. If not, just acknowledging the file is good.
Look & Feel (The Vibe):

Simple and Clean Layout:
A sidebar on the left for "New Chat" and the history list.
The main area on the right for the current chat messages and the input box at the bottom.
Specific Color Palette:
We really want it to use these colors:
#A4CCD9
#C4E1E6
#EBFFD8
rgb(141, 188, 199)
rgb(164, 204, 217)
rgb(196, 225, 230)
rgb(235, 255, 216)
User-Friendly:
It should just feel easy and intuitive to use. No confusion!
Under the Hood (But Important):

Tech Stack:
Frontend: React with Vite (nice and modern).
Backend: FastAPI (Python is great).
Talking to OpenAI:
The backend will securely handle talking to the OpenAI API.
Error Handling:
If something goes wrong (like OpenAI is down, or a file is weird), the app should tell me in a friendly way, not just crash.
Nice-to-Haves for Later (Future Dreams):

User accounts so each person has their own private chat history.
Seeing the AI's response type out word-by-word (streaming) for that cool effect.
Maybe more advanced ways for the AI to work with uploaded documents.
