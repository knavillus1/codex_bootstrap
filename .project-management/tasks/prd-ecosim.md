## 1. Introduction/Overview
"EcoSim Circle of Life" is a simple web-based ecosystem simulator consisting of three organism types: Algae, Herbivores, and Carnivores. The goal is to provide an interactive environment where a single user can start, stop, and tweak simulation parameters without requiring logins or data persistence. All settings reset when the app reloads.

## 2. Goals
- Allow a single user to run the simulation and adjust parameters via a dashboard.
- Visually display organisms in a 2D environment and show text-based statistics for populations and nutrients.
- Maintain acceptable performance as organism counts grow (aim for smooth updates).

## 3. User Stories
1. **As a user**, I want to start or stop the simulation so that I can observe the ecosystem evolve.
2. **As a user**, I want to modify parameters such as initial populations or reproduction thresholds so that I can experiment with different scenarios.
3. **As a user**, I want to view counts of Algae, Herbivores, Carnivores, and total nutrients so that I understand how the simulation is progressing.

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. The system must provide REST endpoints to start, stop, step, and reset the simulation.
2. The system must provide an endpoint to fetch the current state of all organisms for rendering.
3. The system must provide endpoints to get and update simulation parameters.
4. The frontend must render organisms in a 2D canvas or SVG using data from the `/simulation/state` endpoint.
5. The frontend must display text-based statistics showing current organism counts and nutrient levels.
6. All interface elements should follow the layout and style defined in `.project-management/prd-background/PrototypeDesign.html`.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- User authentication or multiple user accounts.
- Persistence of simulation state across sessions.
- Exporting or importing simulation data.
- Graphical charts; statistics will be text only.

## 6. Design Considerations
- Follow the visual layout in `.project-management/prd-background/PrototypeDesign.html` for the dashboard and display area.
- Keep the UI minimal: start/stop buttons, parameter controls, and a panel with text statistics.

## 7. Technical Considerations
- Backend implemented with FastAPI and Python.
- Frontend built with React and Vite.
- Communication through JSON-based REST endpoints (consider WebSockets later for real-time updates).
- Performance should remain acceptable with a moderately large number of organisms; computation occurs primarily on the backend.

## 8. Success Metrics
- The simulation runs smoothly with typical settings (e.g., hundreds of organisms) without noticeable lag.
- Users can adjust parameters and see changes reflected in the simulation state and statistics.

## 9. Open Questions
- What is the maximum expected organism count for the initial MVP?
- Should WebSocket-based state updates be explored in a later iteration?
