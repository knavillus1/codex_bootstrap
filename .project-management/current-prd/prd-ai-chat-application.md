# Product Requirements Document: AI Chat Application

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This PRD defines the requirements for developing a modern AI-powered chat application that enables users to have natural conversations with AI, maintain conversation history, and work with file attachments. The application will feature a ChatGPT-like interface with additional file handling capabilities, built using React/Vite frontend and FastAPI backend, powered by OpenAI's API.

**Problem Statement**: Users need an intuitive, feature-rich chat interface to interact with AI that provides conversation persistence, file upload capabilities, and a clean, modern user experience.

**Goal**: Create a comprehensive chat application that combines the conversational capabilities of modern AI with practical file handling features in an aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly interface.

## 2. Goals

1. **Primary Goal**: Deliver a fully functional AI chat application with conversation management and file handling capabilities
2. **User Experience Goal**: Provide an intuitive, responsive interface that feels natural and modern
3. **Technical Goal**: Implement a scalable full-stack architecture using modern web technologies
4. **Feature Goal**: Enable seamless AI interactions with support for text and file-based conversations
5. **Persistence Goal**: Maintain user conversation history across sessions

## 3. User Stories

### Core Chat Experience
- **As a user**, I want to type messages and receive AI responses so that I can have natural conversations
- **As a user**, I want to see "AI is thinking" indicators so that I know my request is being processed
- **As a user**, I want to start new conversations easily so that I can separate different topics
- **As a user**, I want conversation history so that I can review and continue past discussions

### File Management
- **As a user**, I want to upload images so that I can ask the AI questions about visual content
- **As a user**, I want the AI to get the image uplaoded alongside my current message when I click send

### Interface & Navigation
- **As a user**, I want a clean sidebar with chat history so that I can easily navigate between conversations
- **As a user**, I want clear visual distinction between my messages and AI responses
- **As a user**, I want responsive design so that the application works on different screen sizes

## 4. Functional Requirements

13. **Image Previews**: The system must display small image previews within chat messages
14. **Document Display**: The system must show document filenames and file info in chat messages
15. **AI File Processing**: The system must enable AI to acknowledge and process uploaded files
16. **Vision Capability**: The system should support image analysis using vision-capable OpenAI models

### 4.4 User Interface Requirements
17. **Specific Color Palette**: The system must use the defined color scheme:
    - #A4CCD9 (primary dark)
    - #C4E1E6 (primary medium) 
    - #EBFFD8 (accent)
    - rgb(141, 188, 199) (secondary dark)
18. **Responsive Layout**: The system must provide a sidebar layout with chat history and main chat area
19. **Auto-resizing Input**: The system must provide a textarea that auto-expands for longer messages
20. **Scroll Management**: The system must auto-scroll to show new messages
21. **Clean Visual Design**: The system must implement rounded message bubbles with appropriate spacing

### 4.5 Error Handling & Reliability
22. **API Error Management**: The system must gracefully handle OpenAI API failures with user-friendly messages
23. **File Upload Validation**: The system must validate file types and sizes before upload
24. **Network Error Recovery**: The system must provide clear feedback when network issues occur
25. **Data Persistence**: The system must reliably save and restore conversation data

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **User Authentication**: No user accounts or login system in initial version - OpenAI API key configured in backend and used for all user interaction.
- **Multi-user Support**: Single-user application (conversations not private between users)
- **Advanced Document Processing**: Complex document parsing beyond basic text extraction
- **Mobile App**: Web application only, though should be mobile-responsive
- **Admin Panel**: No administrative interface or user management
- **Analytics/Tracking**: No usage analytics or user behavior tracking
- **Third-party Integrations**: No integration with external services beyond OpenAI

## 6. Design Considerations

The application must implement the design as specified in the HTML mockup located at `.project-management/current-prd/prd-background/design-mock.html`. Key design elements include:

- **Layout**: Two-column layout with 260px sidebar and flexible main chat area
- **Typography**: System fonts (-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto)
- **Message Styling**: Rounded chat bubbles with user messages right-aligned and AI messages left-aligned
- **Color Implementation**: Strict adherence to the specified color palette
