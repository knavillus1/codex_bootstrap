# Product Requirements Document: Historical Chat Delete & Management Menu

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a new feature allowing users to manage their historical chat conversations. The initial implementation will focus on providing a "Delete" functionality for individual chats, along with UI enhancements to support this and future management actions (like "Rename"). This feature addresses the user's need to clean up and organize their chat history.

The main goal is to establish a management menu for historical chats, beginning with the delete functionality, and to provide a more interactive experience with the chat list.

## 2. Goals
-   Allow users to permanently delete any non-active historical chat conversation.
-   Provide clear visual feedback (hover effects, menu icon) indicating that chat items are interactive and have management options.
-   Implement an accessible three-dot (ellipsis) menu for individual chat items, containing "Delete" and "Rename" (placeholder) options.
-   Ensure the "Delete" functionality is robust, removing chat data from the full application stack (frontend and backend).
-   Prevent users from deleting the currently active/open chat session.
-   Deliver an intuitive and straightforward user experience for managing chats.

## 3. User Stories
-   "As a user, I want to see a menu option when I hover over a chat in my history so that I can easily access actions specific to that chat."
-   "As a user, I want to be able to delete a specific chat from my history so that I can keep my chat list organized and remove irrelevant conversations."
-   "As a user, I want the chat I delete to be permanently removed from the system so that it doesn't reappear and my history remains clean."
-   "As a user, I do not want to be able to accidentally delete the chat I am currently viewing or interacting with."
-   "As a user, I want to see a "Rename" option in the chat menu, even if it's not functional yet, so I am aware that renaming might become a future capability."

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  **Chat Item Hover State & Menu Trigger**:
    1.1. When a user hovers their mouse cursor over a chat item in the historical chat list (typically displayed in a left-hand panel), the background color of that chat item must change to a light grey (e.g., `#f0f0f0` or a theme-appropriate subtle highlight) to indicate it's interactive.
    1.2. Simultaneously with the background color change on hover, a three-dot (ellipsis) icon must appear on the right-hand side of the hovered chat item. This icon serves as the trigger for the chat management menu.

2.  **Chat Management Menu (Tooltip Menu)**:
    2.1. Clicking the three-dot icon on a chat item must immediately open a small tooltip/context menu adjacent to the icon.
    2.2. The menu must contain the following options, each with an appropriate icon:
        2.2.1. **Delete**: This option should be accompanied by a standard trash can icon. It will trigger the chat deletion process.
        2.2.2. **Rename**: This option should be accompanied by a standard pencil/edit icon. For this initial implementation, this option is a visual placeholder and will be non-functional (i.e., clicking it does nothing).

3.  **Delete Chat Functionality**:
    3.1. When the user clicks the "Delete" option from the chat management menu for a specific chat:
        3.1.1. The selected chat must be permanently deleted from the application.
        3.1.2. This deletion must encompass both frontend (chat list updated immediately) and backend (chat data removed from storage/database).
    3.2. No confirmation dialog (e.g., "Are you sure you want to delete?") is required before deleting the chat. The action is immediate upon clicking "Delete".
    3.3. **Restriction: Active Chat Deletion**: The currently active/open chat *cannot* be deleted.
        3.3.1. If the three-dot menu is displayed for an active chat item, the "Delete" option within that menu must be visibly disabled (e.g., greyed out) and non-functional.
        3.3.2. Alternatively, the three-dot menu itself may be hidden or not rendered for the active chat item to prevent any delete attempts. (Developer to choose the simpler and clearer implementation).
    3.4. **UI Update Post-Deletion**:
        3.4.1. After a non-active chat is successfully deleted, the chat list in the UI must update immediately to remove the deleted chat item.
        3.4.2. The currently active chat (if one exists and was not the one deleted) shall remain active and unchanged.
        3.4.3. If the deletion results in the chat list becoming empty, a user-friendly message (e.g., "No chats available." or "Your chat history is empty.") must be displayed in the area where the chat list is normally shown.

4.  **Rename Chat Functionality (Placeholder)**:
    4.1. Clicking the "Rename" option in the chat management menu will have no effect and perform no action in this version of the feature. It serves as a UI placeholder for potential future functionality.

5.  **Data Persistence**:
    5.1. The deletion of a chat must be persistent. Once deleted, a chat should not reappear in subsequent application sessions.

6.  **User Context (Single-User Application)**:
    6.1. The application is currently single-user. It is assumed that any chat visible in the history belongs to the sole user of the application.
    6.2. (Future consideration for multi-user: If the system evolves, users should only be able to delete their own chats.)

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
-   Full implementation of the "Rename" chat functionality.
-   "Soft delete" or "undo delete" capabilities. Deletions are permanent.
-   An audit trail or log of chat deletions.
-   Batch deletion (deleting multiple chats at once).
-   Any form of chat archiving.
-   User confirmation dialogs before deletion.
-   Complex UI animations for menu appearance/disappearance beyond standard, simple tooltip behavior.
-   Handling chat deletion when the user is offline (deletion operations assume an active connection to the backend).

## 6. Design Considerations (Optional)
-   **Hover Background Color**: Use a subtle light grey (e.g., `#f0f0f0`, `rgba(0,0,0,0.05)`) or a color that is consistent with the application's existing hover state conventions.
-   **Three-Dot Icon**: A standard vertical ellipsis icon (⋮) or horizontal ellipsis icon (…) is recommended.
-   **Tooltip Menu Styling**: The menu should be styled consistently with any other tooltips or context menus in the application. If no such conventions exist, a simple, clean, and unobtrusive design should be used.
-   **Icons in Menu**:
    -   **Delete**: Use a universally recognizable trash can icon.
    -   **Rename**: Use a universally recognizable pencil or edit icon.
-   **Visual Feedback**: Ensure clear visual distinction between a chat item's normal state, hovered state, and active state (if the active chat is styled differently). The active chat should clearly indicate that deletion is not available for it, as per requirement 3.3.
-   **Empty State Message**: When the chat list is empty, the message ("No chats available.", "Your chat history is empty.") should be clearly visible and centered within the chat list container.

## 7. Technical Considerations (Optional)
-   **Full-Stack Deletion**: The implementation must ensure that chat data is removed from all relevant storage layers (e.g., frontend state, backend database/file system).
-   **API Endpoint**: A new backend API endpoint will be required for deleting a chat, likely a `DELETE` request to a route like `/api/chats/{chat_id}`. This endpoint must validate that the chat is not the active one before proceeding if such a check is also done on the backend.
-   **Frontend State Management**: The frontend application state (e.g., managed by React Context, Redux, Zustand, or similar) must be updated correctly to reflect the removal of a chat and trigger a re-render of the chat list.
-   **Error Handling**:
    -   Implement robust error handling for the deletion process. If deletion fails (e.g., network error, server error), the user should receive clear feedback (e.g., a temporary notification like "Failed to delete chat. Please try again.").
    -   The backend should also prevent deletion of a non-existent chat ID or handle unauthorized attempts gracefully (though less relevant in a single-user context).
-   **Performance**: While not anticipated to be an issue for typical chat list sizes, ensure that hover effects and menu interactions are responsive and do not cause UI lag.

## 8. Success Metrics
-   Users can successfully and reliably delete non-active chats.
-   The chat list UI updates correctly and immediately after a deletion.
-   The active chat cannot be deleted through the UI.
-   Qualitative user feedback (if solicited) indicates the feature is intuitive and useful.
-   Low error rate for the chat deletion API endpoint.

## 9. Open Questions
-   Are there specific icon libraries or design system color codes that must be used for UI elements (hover color, icons)? (For now, general guidance is provided; developer to use existing standards or common sense).
-   What is the desired behavior if a delete operation is initiated but takes a noticeable amount of time to complete on the backend? (For this initial version, assume operations are quick. Future enhancements could include a loading indicator on the specific chat item being deleted).

## 10. Referenced PRD-background files
-   None. This PRD is based on the initial feature request and subsequent clarifications.
